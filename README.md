Hello everyone, I love Immich so I created this tool to download automaticaly photos of 1 person

You've 2 options:

The UI option have input in so you juste have to enter during the input:
- You're immich site (inluding the HTTPS and the / at end)
- You're API key
- The path where you want to save the images (inluding the / at the end)

for the GUI:
There are 3 non-natives libraries:
Just do : 'pip install io pillow easyGUI'


For the non GUI:
Just replace the string at the start


Thank you and pray you gonna like it
